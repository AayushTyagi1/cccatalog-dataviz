# Google Summer of Code (GSoC) 2019
There is no larger compendium of shared human knowledge and creativity than the Commons, including over 1.4 billion digital works available under CC tools. Although a huge amount of CC-licensed content has been
indexed with the [CC Search project](https://search.creativecommons.org/), there is still not a way of conveying the scale of this work to thecommunity. Being able to access visualizations of all the indexed content is a good way for the
community (and CC) to see how much data has been indexed and find and explore
relationships between CC-licensed content on the web.

The frontend app is built using [force-graph](https://github.com/vasturiano/force-graph), [Highcharts](https://www.highcharts.com) and [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/).

## Repository structure

Everything is inside the src folder.
 - index.html: main file. It displays the same web page as in Visualization in production.
 - visualization.html : file that renders the graph. It contains the js script that builds the graph.
 - js folder: contains the required dependencies for the correct visualization of the graph.
 - css folder: styling files. 
 
## Local deploy

Just access to the home.html file in Firefox browser (in Chrome there is a restriction that requires accessing files only through HTTP or HTTPS).
