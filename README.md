# Visualize CC Catalog data

## About

Repository for the visualization of the [CC-Catalog](https://github.com/creativecommons/cccatalog) data.
Current [GSoC project](https://creativecommons.org/2019/05/30/meet-ccs-2019-google-summer-of-code-students/).

There is no larger compendium of shared human knowledge and creativity than the Commons,
including over 1.4 billion digital works available under CC tools. Although a huge amount of CC-licensed content has been
indexed with the [CC Search project](https://search.creativecommons.org/), there is still not a way of conveying the scale of this work to thecommunity. Being able to access visualizations of all the indexed content is a good way for the
community (and CC) to see how much data has been indexed and find and explore
relationships between CC-licensed content on the web.

The frontend app is built using [force-d3](https://github.com/vasturiano/force-graph), [Highcharts](https://www.highcharts.com) and [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/).

## Getting Started

Just access to the home.html file in Firefox browser (in Chrome there is a restriction for accessing files only through HTTP or HTTPS).
